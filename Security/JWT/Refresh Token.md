## 🧠 1. First, What is a Token?

In a secure app (like a Web API):

- You don’t keep the user logged in with a session or cookies (like PHP or old systems).
    
- Instead, the user logs in and receives a **token** (like a key), often in **JWT** format.
    
- That token is sent with each request to prove who you are.
    

Example:

```http
GET /api/posts
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6...
```

This token is called the **Access Token**.

## ⚠️ 2. Problem with Access Tokens

Access Tokens should not live too long because:

- If someone steals it, they can access your account.
    
- It can’t be “revoked” once issued (without lots of effort).
    
- It's risky to give someone a key forever.
    

So we make them **expire quickly** (e.g., in 15 minutes).

But… if the token expires in 15 minutes, **do I need to log in every 15 minutes?** 😨

That’s where the **Refresh Token** comes in.

---

## 🔄 3. What is a Refresh Token?

A **Refresh Token** is like a **spare access card**.

- When your main access token (JWT) expires...
    
- You **send the refresh token to the server**...
    
- The server checks if the refresh token is valid and gives you a **new access token**.
    

You don’t need to **log in again**.

## 🧭 4. Step-by-Step Flow (Analogy + Diagram)

Let’s say you work in a company:

|Step|Analogy|Technical Equivalent|
|---|---|---|
|1|You sign in at the gate|Login (`/login`)|
|2|Security gives you a short pass|Access Token|
|3|You also get a “reissue slip”|Refresh Token|
|4|After 15 mins, your pass expires|Access token expires|
|5|You show the reissue slip to guard|Call `/refresh` API|
|6|He gives you a new pass|New Access Token|

### 🔁 Technical Flow

```text
[User logs in] --> [Server returns AccessToken + RefreshToken]
      ↓
[User sends AccessToken with each API call]
      ↓
[After 15 mins, AccessToken expires]
      ↓
[User sends RefreshToken to /refresh endpoint]
      ↓
[Server validates refresh token]
      ↓
[Server returns new AccessToken (and maybe new RefreshToken)]
```

---

## 💡 Simple Example

### 🧍‍♂️ User logs in

```http
POST /login
{
  "username": "john",
  "password": "1234"
}

Response:
{
  "accessToken": "abc123 (expires in 15 mins)",
  "refreshToken": "xyz456 (valid for 7 days)"
}
```

---

### 🚀 User makes API call

```http
GET /profile
Authorization: Bearer abc123
```

---

### ⏱️ Access Token Expires

After 15 minutes...

```http
GET /profile
Authorization: Bearer abc123

⛔ 401 Unauthorized – Token expired
```

---

### 🔄 User refreshes token

```http
POST /refresh
{
  "refreshToken": "xyz456"
}

Response:
{
  "accessToken": "new_token_abc999",
  "refreshToken": "new_refresh_token_xyz999"
}
```

---

## 🔐 Where are tokens stored?

- **Access token**: in memory or local storage (browser or mobile app)
    
- **Refresh token**: stored securely (httpOnly cookie, or secure mobile storage)
    
- Backend: store refresh token in **database** linked to the user
    

---

## 📦 Summary Table

|Term|Description|
|---|---|
|Access Token|Short-lived key to access API (15 min)|
|Refresh Token|Long-lived key to get a new access token|
|Why needed?|Avoid login every 15 min|
|Where used?|Backend APIs with JWT authentication|
|Where stored?|Client-side (secure) and backend (DB)|
