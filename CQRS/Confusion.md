### 🔍 The Confusion

You're asking:

> "In this line:

```csharp
public class GetUserByIdHandler : IRequestHandler<GetUserByIdQuery, UserDto>
```

I already defined the return type `UserDto` in the query like this:

```csharp
public record GetUserByIdQuery(Guid Id) : IRequest<UserDto>;
```

**So why do I need to specify it again in `IRequestHandler<GetUserByIdQuery, UserDto>`?**"

### ✅ Answer: It’s About C# Generics and Contract Matching

MediatR is built on **generics** and the **Mediator pattern**.

To route a query/command to its handler, MediatR uses the following **convention**:

> "Find a handler that implements `IRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>` where:
> 
> - `TRequest` matches the exact type of the request (e.g., `GetUserByIdQuery`)
>     
> - `TResponse` is the expected return type (e.g., `UserDto`)"
>     

The C# compiler **doesn't infer** `TResponse` from `TRequest`. Even though the `TRequest` (your `GetUserByIdQuery`) already **implements** `IRequest<UserDto>`, the handler must **explicitly** define the full generic interface:

```csharp
IRequestHandler<GetUserByIdQuery, UserDto>
```

### 🧠 Why It's Necessary

1. **MediatR needs both types to resolve the handler**:
    
    - `TRequest` = `GetUserByIdQuery`
        
    - `TResponse` = `UserDto`
        
2. C# **does not infer nested generic parameters**:
    
    - Just because `GetUserByIdQuery : IRequest<UserDto>` doesn't mean the compiler can extract `UserDto` out of it and plug it into the handler interface.
        
3. Think of the handler like this:
    
    ```csharp
    public interface IRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>
        where TRequest : IRequest<TResponse>
    {
        Task<TResponse> Handle(TRequest request, CancellationToken cancellationToken);
    }
    ```
    
    This signature **requires you to specify both** `TRequest` and `TResponse`.

### 🔁 In Other Words

> Even if `GetUserByIdQuery` already contains `UserDto` as a type, **the handler must declare both types explicitly** to match the `IRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>` interface.

This keeps things **type-safe**, explicit, and easier for MediatR to **map requests to handlers** under the hood using reflection and dependency injection.

### ✅ Summary

|Concept|Explanation|
|---|---|
|`IRequest<TResponse>`|Marks a request and defines the expected response|
|`IRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>`|Must explicitly define both types|
|Why both?|C# doesn't infer `TResponse` from `TRequest` in generic constraints|
|MediatR needs both|For routing the request to the correct handler|
