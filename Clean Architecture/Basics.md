**Clean Architecture in .NET Core Web API**

Clean Architecture is a design pattern that emphasizes the separation of concerns, making applications more maintainable, testable, and scalable. It structures the application into distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities and dependencies directed inward.

**Core Layers:**

1. **Domain Layer**:
    
    - Contains the core business logic and entities.
        
    - Independent of external frameworks or technologies.
        
2. **Application Layer**:
    
    - Houses business use cases and service interfaces.
        
    - Depends on the Domain Layer but remains independent of infrastructure and UI concer
        
3. **Infrastructure Layer**:
    
    - Implements interfaces defined in the Application Layer.
        
    - Handles data access, external services, and other technical details.
        
4. **Presentation Layer (Web API)**:
    
    - Manages HTTP requests and responses.
        
    - Interacts with the Application Layer to execute use cases.

**Key Practices:**

- **Dependency Inversion**: Outer layers depend on abstractions defined in inner layers, not on concrete implementations.
    
- **Use of Interfaces**: Interfaces are defined in the Application Layer and implemented in the Infrastructure Layer, promoting loose coupling.
    
- **Entity Framework Core**: Used in the Infrastructure Layer for data access, with DbContext configured to manage database connections and migrations.
    
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data access logic, allowing the Application Layer to interact with data sources through defined interfaces.
    
- **Service Registration**: Services and dependencies are registered in the Startup class, aligning with the Dependency Injection principle.
    

**Benefits:**

- **Maintainability**: Clear separation allows for easier updates and modifications.
    
- **Testability**: Business logic can be tested independently of external systems.
    
- **Scalability**: Modular structure supports growth and addition of new features.
