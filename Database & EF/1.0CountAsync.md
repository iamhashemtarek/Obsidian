**problem :** 
**`await context.Table.CountAsync()` can throw a timeout exception or be very slow when the table contains a large number of rows (e.g., 500k+)**

### üí° **SQL Server didn't have up-to-date statistics or a good execution plan initially**

Your manual query in SSMS forced SQL Server to:

- **Compile a fresh execution plan**
    
- Possibly **update stale statistics**
    
- **Warm the cache (buffer pool)** with data pages
    

Which then made your endpoint suddenly fast.

## üîç What's Really Happening Behind the Scenes?

### 1. **Stale Statistics**

SQL Server uses **statistics** to estimate how many rows a query will return.

If stats are outdated:

- SQL Server **under- or overestimates** row count
    
- It chooses **inefficient query plans**
    
- This can lead to **timeouts**, especially on large tables like 500k+ rows
    

### 2. **Cold Cache (Buffer Pool)**

Before you run the query, SQL Server might need to:

- **Read 500k+ rows from disk**, which is slow
    
- After you run the query manually, **data is cached in memory**, making the endpoint faster
    

### 3. **Execution Plan Caching Issues**

- First run: query gets a **bad cached plan**
    
- Manual run: forces SQL Server to **recompile** and optimize correctly

## üß™ Reproducing the Fix (What You Did That Helped)

You ran this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT TOP 500000 Id FROM Representatives ORDER BY Id) AS tmp;
```

This forced:

- A fresh query plan
    
- Statistics evaluation
    
- Data load into cache
    

And then your app‚Äôs `CountAsync()` worked without timeout.

## ‚úÖ How to Fix It Properly

### ‚úÖ 1. **Update Statistics**

Run manually:

```sql
UPDATE STATISTICS dbo.Representatives;
```

Or for all tables:

```sql
EXEC sp_updatestats;
```

To automate:

- Make sure **Auto Update Statistics** is enabled:
    

```sql
SELECT name, is_auto_update_stats_on 
FROM sys.databases 
WHERE name = 'YourDatabase';
```

If not:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE YourDatabase SET AUTO_UPDATE_STATISTICS ON;
```

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Warm Up with a Scheduled Query**

Optionally, run a `COUNT(*)` or simple `SELECT` at app startup or daily as a ‚Äúwarming query.‚Äù

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Force Recompile in Query (Optional)**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbo.Representatives
OPTION (RECOMPILE);
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Use only for debugging or one-off queries ‚Äî not recommended in production.

## üß† Summary

|Observation|Real Cause|
|---|---|
|`CountAsync()` times out on large table|Bad plan or cold cache|
|Adding `OrderBy()` helped before|Triggered better plan accidentally|
|Running query in SSMS fixed it|Updated stats + plan + warmed cache|
