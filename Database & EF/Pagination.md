### Internal Differences:
1. **Execution in PostgreSQL (`LIMIT` + `OFFSET`)**:
   - **The database engine retrieves all matching rows first.**
   - It then applies `OFFSET` to skip the specified number of rows.
   - Finally, it applies `LIMIT` to return the requested number of rows.
   - This method is straightforward but can become inefficient for large datasets if not optimized.

2. **Execution in SQL Server (`OFFSET` + `FETCH`)**:
   - SQL Server uses a more optimized approach when `ORDER BY` is present.
   - **It applies `OFFSET` as part of the query execution plan, avoiding fetching unnecessary rows.**
   - **`FETCH NEXT` ensures only the needed rows are processed.**
   - This is often more efficient compared to `LIMIT/OFFSET` in PostgreSQL because it leverages indexing better.

### Performance Considerations:
- In **PostgreSQL**, `LIMIT/OFFSET` can lead to performance issues when paginating large datasets, as it still processes all rows before applying the skip/take.
- In **SQL Server**, `OFFSET/FETCH` is optimized to work within the execution plan, making it faster with proper indexing.

### Alternative Optimizations:
- **PostgreSQL**: Use **cursor-based pagination** or indexed queries to improve efficiency.
- **SQL Server**: Use **keyset pagination** (e.g., filtering by indexed `Id`) instead of `OFFSET/FETCH` for better performance.
