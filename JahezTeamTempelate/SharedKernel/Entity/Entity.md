Great question, Hashem! Even though **interfaces** now support **default implementations**, there are still a few reasons why you opted for an **abstract class** (`Entity`) instead of just relying on an interface (`IEntity`). Let’s break it down:

### **Key Reasons Why an Abstract Class Was Necessary**
1. **Encapsulation of State (`_domainEvents`)**
   - An **interface** cannot have fields, but your domain events require **internal state management** (`_domainEvents` list).
   - If you tried to implement this in the interface, you'd be forced to manage state at the concrete class level, rather than having a unified approach.

2. **Controlled Access Modifiers**
   - You needed a **private list** (`_domainEvents`) to ensure encapsulation.
   - Interfaces **cannot have private members**, whereas abstract classes allow better **control over visibility**.

3. **Avoiding Redundant Code**
   - If `IEntity` had **default implementations**, each implementing class would **still need to manage the `_domainEvents` list separately**.
   - The **abstract class centralizes** this logic, eliminating the need for repetitive code across multiple entity implementations.

4. **Constructors & Initialization**
   - Abstract classes allow you to define **constructors**, which can help in **setting up** default states.
   - Since `IEntity` is an interface, it **cannot have constructors**, making it less effective for handling initial state.

5. **Flexibility for Further Enhancements**
   - The `Entity` class could later be extended with additional logic (e.g., logging, validation) without modifying the interface structure.
   - Interfaces are meant for **contracts**, whereas abstract classes define a **foundation** with built-in logic.

### **Would Default Interface Implementation Work Here?**
While **C# 8+ allows default implementations in interfaces**, it still lacks **stateful management** capabilities. The closest alternative would be defining **static methods** in an interface, but that wouldn’t allow instance-level event tracking.

### **Final Thought**
Your design decision ensures **proper encapsulation**, **reusability**, and **maintainability** of domain events. It aligns well with **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)** principles where entities should **control their own state**.
