**you _can_ use `IResult` in controllers**, and your code will **compile and work** ‚Äî but it's **not the intended or idiomatic approach** when using ASP.NET Core MVC (Controller-based APIs).

To understand why, let's break it down with full technical reasoning.

---

# üß† What Is `IResult`?

`IResult` is part of the **Minimal APIs infrastructure** in ASP.NET Core. It is an interface that defines:

```csharp
public interface IResult
{
    Task ExecuteAsync(HttpContext httpContext);
}
```

So anything implementing `IResult` knows **how to write itself to the HTTP response** directly.

Examples: `Results.Ok()`, `Results.Problem()`, etc.

---

# üö¶ What Is `ActionResult`?

`ActionResult<T>` is the standard return type for **controller actions**. It's part of the **MVC pipeline**, and supports:

- **Model state validation**
    
- **Content negotiation**
    
- **Result filters**
    
- **OpenAPI / Swagger metadata**
    

---

# üß™ What Happens If You Return `IResult` from a Controller?

It works **because** ASP.NET Core is smart. If you return an `IResult` from a controller, it:

1. **Executes the result** via `ExecuteAsync(HttpContext)`
    
2. But you **bypass many MVC features**, such as:
    
    - Automatic model state validation
        
    - `ProducesResponseType` metadata
        
    - `ActionResult<T>` serialization conventions
        
    - Swagger/OpenAPI annotations
        
    - Filters (`OnResultExecuting`, etc.)

# üÜö `IResult` vs `ActionResult` in Controllers

|Feature|`ActionResult<T>` (Recommended)|`IResult` (Minimal API style)|
|---|---|---|
|Pipeline integration|‚úÖ Full MVC support|‚ö†Ô∏è Partial|
|Filters (`IResultFilter`, etc.)|‚úÖ Works|‚ùå Skipped|
|Content negotiation (JSON/XML/etc.)|‚úÖ Based on `Accept` headers|‚ùå Manual or basic|
|Swagger response documentation|‚úÖ Auto-documented|‚ùå Not detected automatically|
|Model state validation|‚úÖ Auto if `[ApiController]`|‚ùå Must do manually|
|Flexibility in writing to response|‚ö†Ô∏è Less granular|‚úÖ Full control|

# üîß What You‚Äôre Doing in Your Code

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public async Task<IResult> Login([FromBody]LoginDto input, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    Result<LoginResponse> result = await GetCommandHandler<LoginCommand,LoginResponse>()
                                    .Handle(new LoginCommand(input.UserIdentifier, input.Password, input.RememberMe),
                                    cancellationToken);
    return result.Match(Results.NoContent, CustomResults.Problem);
}
```

### This works because:

- `IResult` implements `ExecuteAsync(HttpContext)`
    
- ASP.NET Core will let it write to the response directly
    

But:

> ‚ùó You are **bypassing** the MVC result pipeline.

---

# üéØ Best Practice

Since you're inside a **Controller**, stick to returning `ActionResult<T>` (or `IActionResult`) unless you **intentionally want to short-circuit** the MVC behavior.

### Recommended version:

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public async Task<IActionResult> Login([FromBody] LoginDto input, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    var result = await GetCommandHandler<LoginCommand, LoginResponse>()
                        .Handle(new LoginCommand(input.UserIdentifier, input.Password, input.RememberMe),
                        cancellationToken);

    return result.Match<IActionResult>(
        _ => NoContent(),
        error => Problem(error.Message) // or use custom ProblemDetails
    );
}
```

# ‚úÖ When Would You _Intentionally_ Use `IResult` in Controllers?

Rarely ‚Äî and only when:

- You need fine control over the HTTP response
    
- You‚Äôre integrating minimal APIs and controllers and want to **share result-producing logic** (e.g., `Result<T>.Match(Results.Ok, Results.BadRequest)` reused across layers)
    
- You‚Äôre wrapping logic in reusable **middleware-style patterns** across endpoints
    

But even then, consider **mapping `IResult` to `ActionResult`** inside your controller:

```csharp
IResult result = service.Handle(...);
return new ResultExecutorAdapter(result); // wraps it for controller
```

---

# üõ† Bonus Tip: Mapping `IResult` to `ActionResult`

If you _really_ want to unify them, you can create an adapter like this:

```csharp
public class ResultExecutorAdapter : IActionResult
{
    private readonly IResult _result;

    public ResultExecutorAdapter(IResult result)
    {
        _result = result;
    }

    public async Task ExecuteResultAsync(ActionContext context)
    {
        await _result.ExecuteAsync(context.HttpContext);
    }
}
```

Use it like this:

```csharp
return new ResultExecutorAdapter(Results.Ok("Hello from minimal style"));
```

Would you like a reusable helper to map `Result<T>` to `ActionResult<T>` or a generic pattern for clean architecture mapping between application and web layers?
